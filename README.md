## Problems/Exercises from the "Top Interview 150" study plan.

The solutions **are not the best** but they are done without the use of hints or peeking at solutions except when mentioned.

My approach is to make something that works and is accepted by the judge. I don't spend time optimizing. If the solution runs slowly compared to others', I just look at other people's solutions.
